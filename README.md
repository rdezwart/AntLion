# AntLion
## For the general public:
This repository was created for collaboration during the Foundations of Game Design (IAT 312) course at Simon Fraser University. This will be used to synchronize any changes made through the course of this project.

## For my group:
Here's my code for our redesign! I'll be updating this as we go, and so we can track any changes made throughout the project. 

Most of the files you can ignore, but if you drill down to the [src](src/rdz/antlion) folder you can find the Java code. I also switched to a new IDE, [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) \(instead of Eclipse\). I've been told it's better overall, and I'm enjoying it so far. :smile:
