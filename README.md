Here's my code for our redesign! I'll be updating this as we go, and so we can track any changes made throughout the project. 

Most of the files you can ignore, but if you drill down to the [src](src) folder you can find the Java code. I also switched to a new IDE, [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) \(instead of Eclipse\). I've been told it's better overall, and I'm enjoying it so far. :smile:
