# AntLion Redesign
## For the general public:
This repository was created for collaboration during the [Foundations of Game Design](https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2019/summer/iat/312/d100) course at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/). This will be used to synchronize any changes made through the course of this project.

All the code has been written by me, except for the external [Processing](https://processing.org/) library. The necessary files for that have been included already. 

However, you do need the [Java 12 SDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html), the one used for developing this. 

## For my group:
Here's my code for our redesign! I'll be updating this as we go, and so we can track any changes made throughout the project. 

Most of the files you can ignore, but if you drill down to the [src](src) folder you can find the Java code. I also switched to a new IDE, [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (instead of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)). I've been told it's better overall, and I'm enjoying it so far. :smile:

The core Processing library is also included in this repo, so there should be no real need to relink it. Let me know if otherwise!
